# Network-Coding
An Android app for simulating network coding in Butterfly Network

In Network Coding, A Node instead of simply relaying the packets of information they receive, the nodes of a network take several packets and combine them together for transmission. This helps in reaching the maximum network flow in a network.

Combining information is acheived using XOR. XOR is particularly used as it is easy to retrive back the individual information.

This app aims to demonstrate the technique via sending text message across the network.
